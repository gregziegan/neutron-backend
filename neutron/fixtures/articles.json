      "content": "Updated on September 16 at 1:13 p.m. ET\nA 14-year-old Texas boy tried to impress his teacher with a homemade clock in the first few weeks of high school. Ahmed Mohamed’s invention landed him in handcuffs when officials at his school in Irving thought it resembled a bomb and called police.\nAhmed vowed he will never take an invention to school again—though he may be taking one to the White House.\nHere’s the background: Ahmed said he took the clock to school on Monday because none of his teachers at MacArthur High “know what I can do.” The Dallas Morning News reports that the ninth-grader makes his own radios and repairs his own go-kart. The newspaper says the door to his bedroom “marks the border where the Mohamed family’s cramped but lavishly decorated house begins to look like the back room at RadioShack.” Here’s more:\nAhmed’s clock was hardly his most elaborate creation. He said he threw it together in about 20 minutes before bedtime on Sunday: a circuit board and power supply wired to a digital display, all strapped inside a case with a tiger hologram on the front.\nHe showed it to his engineering teacher first thing Monday morning and didn’t get quite the reaction he’d hoped for.\n“He was like, ‘That’s really nice,’” Ahmed said. “‘I would advise you not to show any other teachers.’”\nBut the clock’s alarm went off during English and his teacher complained. Ahmed showed her the invention after class.\n“She was like, it looks like a bomb,” he told the newspaper. “I told her, ‘It doesn’t look like a bomb to me.’”\nShe kept the clock. In the sixth period, the principal and a police officer pulled the 14-year-old out of class. He was taken to another room where he found four other officers waiting. One who sat in the back, he says, said: “Yup. That’s who I thought it was.”\nAhmed says he felt conscious of the color of his skin and his name. The questions, he says, kept coming.\n“They were like, ‘So you tried to make a bomb?’” Ahmed told the Morning News.\n“I told them no, I was trying to make a clock.”\n“He said, ‘It looks like a movie bomb to me.’”\nA police spokesman, James McLellan, told the newspaper that while Ahmed never said the device he built was anything but a clock, officers suspect he wasn't telling them the whole story.\n“It could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car,” he said. “The concern was, what was this thing built for? Do we take him into custody?”\nAhmed was led out of the school at 3 p.m., his hands cuffed behind him. He was sent to a juvenile detention center where he was fingerprinted, and then reunited with his parents. The principal suspended him for three days.\nAhmed's sister told me to post this. Yes this situation is real for those questioning. pic.twitter.com/Oxd0JxUS6O\n— Prajwol/Ru (@OfficalPrajwol) September 16, 2015\n“He just wants to invent good things for mankind,” said Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, Ahmed’s father, an immigrant from Sudan. “But because his name is Mohamed and because of September 11, I think my son got mistreated.”\nAt a news conference Wednesday, Irving Police Chief Larry Body said Ahmed would not be charged.\n“We have no evidence to support that there was an intention to create alarm or cause people to be concerned,” he said.\nA letter from Dan Cummings, the school principal, to parents said the “Irving Police Department responded to a suspicious-looking item on campus yesterday. We are pleased to report that after the police department’s assessment he item discovered at school did not pose a threat to your child’s safety.”\nI recommend using this opportunity to talk with your child about the Student Code of Conduct and specifically not bringing items to school that are prohibited. Also, this is a good time to remind your child how important it is to immediately report any suspicious items and/or suspicious behavior they observe to any school employee so we can address it right away.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations said it was investigating Ahmed’s case.\nThe Guardian adds that this is the second high-profile case involving Islam in Irving, about 15 miles northwest of Dallas. Beth Van Duyne, Irving’s mayor, “became something of a national celebrity after she accused Islamic leaders of “bypassing American courts” by offering voluntary Shariah-law mediation to worshippers.”\nThe case has received national attention.\nCool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.\n— President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015\nAssumptions and fear don't keep us safe—they hold us back. Ahmed, stay curious and keep building. https://t.co/ywrlHUw3g1\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 16, 2015",

      "content": "A Texas high school freshman said he was arrested Monday after one of his teachers said a homemade clock he had brought to school looked like a bomb.\nThe Dallas Morning News reported late Tuesday that Ahmed Mohamed, 14, had been suspended from MacArthur High School in Irving. Police said Wednesday that Mohamed would not be charged with a crime and they considered the case closed.\n“There’s no evidence to support the perception he intended to create alarm,\" Irving police chief Larry Boyd said.\nThe incident went viral on social media and the hashtag #IStandWithAhmed was the top non-promoted U.S. trend on Twitter early Wednesday morning. Some supporters alleged Mohamed was arrested only because of his name, or the way he looked. Others claimed the situation was a case of Islamaphobia.\nPresident Barack Obama tweeted from his @POTUS account to Mohamed: \"Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.\"\nBoyd said authorities would have reacted to the incident with the same caution if it had been a white student.\n\"Our reaction would have been the same either way,\" he said. \"That’s a very suspicious device. We live in an age where you cant take things like that to a school.”\nCool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.\n— President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015\nMohamed told the News that he built the clock in about 20 minutes Sunday evening using a pencil case, a circuit board, and a power supply wired to a digital display. Mohamed said he showed it to his engineering teacher Monday morning.\n\"He was like, 'That’s really nice,'\" Mohamed told the paper. \"'I would advise you not to show any other teachers.'\"\nLater in the day, the News reported, Mohamed's English teacher complained when the clock beeped in the middle of a lesson. When Mohamed showed her the device after class, he claims she told him, \"It looks like a bomb.\"\n\"It doesn’t look like a bomb to me,\" Mohamed says he told her. The teacher kept the device, and the school's principal and a police officer pulled Mohamed out of class and brought him to a room where five other officers questioned him and searched his belongings.\n\"It could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car,\" Irving police spokesman James McLellan told the News. \"The concern was, what was this thing built for? Do we take him into custody?\" McClellan admitted that Mohamed had always maintained the device was a clock and officers had no reason to believe the contraption is dangerous.\nUltimately, the paper reported Mohamed was taken to a juvenile detention center, fingerprinted, and released to his parents, who claimed their son was singled out because he is Muslim.\n\"He just wants to invent good things for mankind,\" Ahmed’s father Mohamed told the News. \"But because his name is Mohamed and because of Sept. 11, I think my son got mistreated.\"\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations is investigating the incident. Alia Salem, the director of the organization's North Texas chapter, said the case \"raises a red flag\" and \"seems pretty egregious.\"\nBoyd said he hopes the incident doesn't sully the relationship between Irving's Muslim community and the police department.\n\"Obviously situations like this make it challenging as we work on relationships with a community,\" Boyd said. \"We have spent a lot of time and energy and have worked well with our Muslim community. I do not expect that to stop.”\nDuring his afternoon briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters the Obama administration viewed the case as a \"teachable moment.\"\n\"This episode is a good illustration of how pernicious stereotypes can prevent even good hearted people from doing good work,\" Earnest said. \"The White House was pleased to extend an invitation to Ahmed to participate in Astronomy Night. We'll bring together NASA scientists, others to spend time with young people. It will be an opportunity to talk about science, the solar system. It should be a good event. We're hopeful he'll feel right at home.\"\nClick for more from the Dallas Morning News.",

      "title": "Muslim 9th Grader Ahmed Mohamed Arrested For Bringing Homemade Clock To School",
      "content": "A ninth-grade student in Irving, Texas, was arrested and sent to juvenile detention Monday after bringing a homemade clock to school, according to The Dallas Morning News.\nAhmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old at MacArthur High School who is Muslim, told the outlet he's passionate about robotics and decided to link a circuit board, power supply and digital clock display together inside a pencil case. He brought the device to school hoping to impress some teachers, but the first one who saw the clock immediately told him \"not to show any other teachers.\"\nLater that day, Ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to the principal's office. He says he was threatened with expulsion, asked if he tried \"to make a bomb\" and led out of the school in handcuffs by police officers.\n\"They were like, ‘So you tried to make a bomb?’\" the student told the Morning News.\n\"I told them no, I was trying to make a clock.\"\n\"He said, 'It looks like a movie bomb to me.'\"\nAfter his arrest, Ahmed was transferred to juvenile detention, where he was fingerprinted and then released to his parents. He is currently serving a three-day suspension from school.\nDuring a press conference Wednesday -- held after the incident had generated outrage on social media and elicited responses from Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and a NASA engineer -- the Irving Police Department said there was no evidence of intent to create harm and any case against Ahmed would be dropped.\nThe police also passed out a photograph of the clock he built.\nAlia Salem, the director of the North Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called the arrest an egregious and inappropriate response. Her group is meeting with an attorney Wednesday morning to consider legal action.\n\"The fact remains this kid is a really bright student, an award-winning robotics inventor and tinkerer,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"They automatically jumped to a conclusion that I don't believe they would've jumped to had he been 'Jimmy.'\"\nA letter sent out to parents by the Irving Independent School District on Tuesday didn't mention that Ahmed brought a clock to school, but said the police department found a \"suspicious-looking item.\" They urged parents to speak with their students about the district's code of conduct, specifically the section on items prohibited from school.\nThat list of items includes weapons, fireworks, knives and pepper spray, as well as \"look-alike\" weapons, but makes no mention of clocks being forbidden.\nThe hashtag #IStandWithAhmed began trending on Twitter after Ahmed's arrest was first reported Tuesday, with thousands chastising the arrest and suspension. His family soon created a Twitter account with the same name, from which Momahed tweeted thanks Wednesday morning.\nThe Huffington Post has reached out to the Irving Police Department and the Irving Independent School District for comment.\nThis story has been updated to include information from the police press conference.\nAlso On HuffPost:",

      "title": "14-Year-Old Muslim Student Detained, Interrogated on Charges of Making ‘Hoax Bomb’ — He Says There’s Much More to the Story",
      "content": "A 14-year-old high school student was arrested Monday for bringing what was labeled a “hoax bomb” to school, but he says he just wanted to show off his love of inventing to his new teachers.\nAhmed Mohamed said he was encouraged by his father to take a homemade electric clock he constructed over the weekend to MacArthur High School in Texas on Monday in order to show off his skills to his engineering teacher. According to KXAS-TV, the clock began to ring while in Mohamed’s backpack during a different class later in the day. That teacher then had Mohamed show her the clock after other students left the room and confiscated it.\n“She said, ‘Well it looks like a bomb. Don’t show it to anyone else,’” Mohamed, who aspires to be an inventor, told KXAS-TV. “And she decides to take it from me.”\nPolice later showed up at the high school and handcuffed and arrested Mohamed.\n“I really don’t think it’s fair at all because I just brought something to school that wasn’t a threat to anyone, it didn’t do anything wrong. I just showed my teacher something, and I end up being arrested later that day.” the 14-year-old said.\nMohamed, who has been suspended from the school, told the Dallas Morning News that he was interrogated by several police officers who confiscated his tablet and his invention, which he said took him only 20 minutes to build. Mohamed said the police took mug shots and wouldn’t allow him to call his parents for help.\nMohamed’s parents told KXAS that they blamed discrimination for how their son was treated.\n“We are in the melting pot. We are in the greatest country,” his father, Elhassan Mohamed, said. “We need this trouble not to hinder us, as Muslims, as Christians, as Jews, or whatever you are.”\n“He just wants to invent good things for mankind,” his father, who immigrated to the U.S. from Sudan, said.\nThe clock was built using a pencil case that was shut with a cable. Mohamed said he purposefully didn’t use a lock so that it wouldn’t look suspicious, but police still described the container as a suitcase or briefcase.\n“It made me feel like I wasn’t human,” he said. “It made me feel like I was a criminal.”\nIrving Police Officer James McLellan told KXAS-TV that school officials called law enforcement because they thought the device was suspicious and wanted to exercise caution.\n“A lot of these details that the family and he have provided to you were not shared with us yesterday,” McLellan said. “He was very much less than forthcoming.”\nMcLellan told the Morning News that Mohamed “kept maintaining it was a clock, but there was no broader explanation.”\nIn a press conference Wednesday, Irving police said they will not pursue charges against Mohamed.\n“We have no evidence that there was an intention to create alarm,” Irving Police Chief Larry Boyd said. “I couldn’t speak to whether [the device] works for sure, but it’s not an explosive device.”\nAn Irving Independent School District spokesperson declined to discuss specific details of the situation, but released the following statement to KXAS:\n“Around 3 p.m. yesterday, a MacArthur High School student was arrested on campus by the Irving Police Department. School officials have been cooperating fully with the police investigation, and while privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details about student discipline, we can assure everyone that school administrators are handling the situation in accordance with the Irving ISD Student Code of Conduct and applicable laws.\nWe always ask our students and staff to immediately report if they observe any suspicious items and/or suspicious behavior. If something is out of the ordinary, the information should be reported immediately to a school administrator and/or the police so it can be addressed right away. We will always take necessary precautions to protect our students and keep our school community as safe as possible.”\nMohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he does not plan to take one of his inventions to school ever again.\n“This all raises a red flag for us: how Irving’s government entities are operating in the current climate,” Alia Salem, director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ North Texas chapter said. “We’re still investigating, but it seems pretty egregious.”\nBesides the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Mohamed has garnered support from many strangers nationwide who took to social media to protest how the teenager was treated. On Wednesday morning the hashtag “#IStandWithAhmed” was the number one trending topic on Twitter in the U.S. with celebrities weighing in.\nI expect they will have more to say tomorrow, but Ahmed's sister asked me to share this photo.

      "content": "A 14-year-old boy says he was just trying to show off his engineering skill when he brought a digital clock he had made to his new high school in Irving, Texas. But Ahmed Mohamed was detained and reportedly suspended from school, after a teacher thought that his clock looked like a bomb.\nThe aspiring engineer repeatedly said that it was not, in fact, a bomb. But the teacher and the principal of MacArthur High School were alarmed, and they called police, who questioned Mohamed, handcuffed him and led him out of school. He was then fingerprinted before being released to his family, who say he received a three-day suspension from school.\nUpdate at 1:40 p.m. ET: Obama Invites Mohamed To White House\n\"Cool clock, Ahmed,\" President Obama wrote in a tweet around midday Wednesday. \"Want to bring it to the White House?

      "content": "A 14 year-old high school freshman was arrested Monday in Texas for bringing a homemade digital clock to school. Apparently, he brought it to school to show it off but a teacher, concerned that it looked like a bomb (and not without justification), called police. Mohamed was led out of school by police in handcuffs and suspended for three days.\nAhmed did nothing wrong. A kid showing off his technical kills should not result in an arrest or a suspension.\nHowever, there is also no evidence the police did anything wrong. In the age of Columbine (where high school students really do bring bombs to school) and Sandy Hook, police and schools are required to be hyper-cautious.\nBut unlike what the race-baiting mainstream media headlines are screaming, what Ahmed built does not look like a simple “clock.”\nI’d love to see how the Secret Service and TSA would react to such a thing. Maybe we’ll find out. President Obama has already invited Ahmed and his suitcase clock to the White House.\nAnd America’s Race-Grifters have already started their arson fires.\nCNN: Muslim teen Ahmed Mohamed creates clock, shows teachers, gets arrested\nHillary Clinton: “Assumptions and fear don’t keep us safe—they hold us back. Ahmed, stay curious and keep building.”\nCNN’s Sally Kohn: “Hey right wing, your fear-mongering anti-Muslim rhetoric got a kid arrested for a science project. Hope you’re happy.”\nDaily Beast: “It took a nerd with guts to stand up against the most Islamophobic part of the country.”\nApparently, the black police officer pictured above is guilty of racial profiling, or something…\nNaturally, these shameless opportunists expressed zero outrage when a fifth-grader, a full four years younger than Ahmed, was arrested and charged with brandishing a weapon for bringing a toy gun on a school bus.\nWhy would they? There’s no political upside for the Left unless you can scream racism.\nThen there was the 7 year-old boy suspended for a Pop Tart Gun.\nOnce again: No political upside, no media uproar, no White House invite.\nThen there was the 5th grade girl who was searched by school officials for possessing a paper gun.\nNo political upside means no media uproar and no White House invite.\nA first-grader was suspended for brandishing a chicken finger and using the words “pew, pew.”\nNo political upside, no media urproar, no White House invite.\nAn 8th grader in New York was suspended for wearing a NRA t-shirt.\nWrong kind of victim, no media uproar, no White House invite.\nA young school girl was suspended in Tennessee for saying “God bless you.”\nWrong kind of victim, no media uproar, no White House invite.\nTwelve students were suspended in Washington State for praying.\nWrong kind of victim, no media uproar, no White House invite.\nThe problem here is not Ahmed, and not the police officer(s) who arrested him (that we know of), and not any of these other students victimized over the years by the stupid and the fascist who populate too many of our schools.\nThe problem is hysterical Zero Tolerance school policies.\nIf it takes The Right Kind Of Victim for the Left and MSM to finally speak out against this issue, something the Right has been hollering about for years, maybe some good can come of it.\nBut I doubt it.\nThe Left and their MSM just want to call Texas racist.\nCuz…\nGrifters gunna grift.\nHoaxers gunna hoax.\n—\n—\nRead More Stories About:",

      "title": "Boy Arrested for Building Clock Gets a White House Invite From Obama",
      "content": "Ahmed Mohamed thought he was building a clock, but it turned out to be a magnet for fear and misunderstanding. Now he’s got an invitation to tell his story at the White House.\nPresident Barack Obama on Wednesday invited the 14-year-old high school freshman to attend Astronomy Night at the White House on Oct. 19. That came a day after police in Irving, Texas, arrested him after mistaking his engineering project for a bomb.\nMark Zuckerberg, the billionaire founder of the social networking giant Facebook Inc., also invited Mohamed to visit his company’s headquarters.\n“It’s clear that at least some of Ahmed’s teachers failed him. That’s too bad, but it’s not too late for all of us to see this as a teachable moment,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters today in Washington. “Pernicious stereotypes can affect even good people.”\nAccording to the Dallas Morning News, an English teacher confiscated the device and alerted authorities while Mohamed insisted it was a clock he built for class. Irving Police Chief Larry Boyd told the newspaper that police then handcuffed the boy and took him to a juvenile detention center.\nHe wasn’t charged and was turned over to his parents, Boyd told the paper.\n‘Having the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause, not arrest,’’ Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. “The future belongs to people like Ahmed.”",
